**Based on designs by:** ...


## 🔨 Built using:
- React.js
- SCSS
- Webpack
- Babel
- Chrome


## 🏢 Building the App...
Requires npm or yarn (instructions below use npm)

Download, fork, or clone the repo locally
In your CLI, navigate to the project directory
Run npm install to install local dependencies

## ...for Development
Run 'npm run build-dev' to build the project for local development

Any changes to files inside the src/ directory will trigger a hot reload


## Browser Support
- Chrome 👌 
- Firefox 
	- performance issue with filter blur effects on some devices, works fine on others 🤷‍♀️
- Edge
	- simplified landing page
	- videos lack fullscreen
- Safari
	- some screwy functionality (character navigation), otherwise not bad!


### Missing Functionality (for future dev)
- Page-to-page transitions
- Per character/episode anchoring
- Gesture controls


### Areas of Improvement
- Episode preview controls 
- Generally fancier animations
- Responsivess for windowed desktop
- More tightly cropped assets for specific aspect ratios
- Small/Medium/Large (etc.) for ALL assets to reduce file sizes and increase performance
- Controls (mouse wheel, keyboard)
- Scrolling behaviour on Character text
- Accessibility (such as Episode preview controls, some tabIndexing needed in places)
- SEO
- Improved transitioning between Episode previews
- More videos/episodes/characters/stills for added variety
